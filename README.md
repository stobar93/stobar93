ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sebastian Tobar @stobar93

+ ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a Full Stack Developer.
+ I have experience using PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express.js, React, Redux. 
Also, I've worked for almost 5 years as an Industrial Engineer. I like to integrate both careers to provide practical solutions to complex problems.

+ ðŸŒ± I finished the bootcamp at Henry on november 2021. Also I like to take online courses to improve my tech and soft skills.
Currently I am taking the Git and GitHub professional course on Platzi in order to fully understand the github flow so I can 
collaborate on open source projects, be a better colleague and contribute successfully to those useful tools and libraries that help us on our everyday work.

+ I joined the IxDF Interaction Design Foundation on september 2021 because I want to understand the UX principles to use them
in my future projects and to build high impact web apps.
